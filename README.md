Bareclad is a new type of database, based on [transitional modeling](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329352497_Modeling_Conflicting_Unreliable_and_Varying_Information "Transitional Modeling Paper"). 
There are a number of posts on the topic that can be found in our blog on [anchormodeling.com](http://www.anchormodeling.com/tag/transitional/). 
The database engine will provide and combine features from relational, graph, columnar, and name-value pair databases. 
Modeling is bottom-up and respects the uncertain and subjecive nature of reality.

The database also features the new transitional query language, Traqula, structured as:

SEARCH -> (WHERE) -> (AGGREGATE) -> RETURN.
